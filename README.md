## "Hands On Computer Vision with Julia"

---

## Introduction:
Through this book, there will be thorough guidance for all developers who want to get started with building computer vision applications using Julia.<br>
Julia is well suited for image processing because of its ease of use and the fact that it lets you write easy-to-compile and efficient machine code.<br>
Readers will be taken through various packages that support image processing in Julia, and will also tap into open-source libraries such as OpenCV and Tesseract to find optimum solutions to problems encountered in computer vision. They will learn to build a full-fledged image processing application using JuliaImages, perform basic to advanced image and video stream processing with Julia's APIs, and much more.<br>

- ### Who this book is for<br>
This book is for all those Julia developers who are interested in learning how to perform image processing, for those who want to explore the field of computer vision and wish to benefit from this book.<br>
A basic knowledge of Julia will help you understand concepts more effectively.<br><br>

## Chapter (1) - Getting Started with JuliaImages
Getting Started with JuliaImages, is about getting your first introduction to JuliaImages and ImageCore packages. We will be loading images from various sources and creating thumbnails, that is resizing and saving them back on disk in a different file format.<br>

## Chapter (2) - Image Enhancement
Image Enhancement, is all about working with the ImageFiltering package. We will understand what linear and nonlinear filtering operations are and how they can be used to transform images, such as sharpening, blurring, and smoothing.<br>

## Chapter (3) - Image Adjustment
Image Adjustment, will guide you through the ImageMorphology package. Morphological transformations are some simple operations based on the image shape that allow you to remove small noise, shrink objects, separate objects, and increase the object size or background space.<br>

## Chapter (4) - Image Segmentation
Image Segmentation, will explore the ImageSegmentation package. Readers will learn how to use supervised and unsupervised methods to simplify or represent an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.<br>

## Chapter (5) - Image Representation
Image Representation, will explore the ImageFeatures package. We will learn to compute compact descriptors or "features" in a form that permits comparison and matching of two images.<br>

## Chapter (6) - Introduction to Neural Networks
Introduction to Neural Networks, will demonstrate the need for neural networks. We'll cover getting, preparing the data, and improving and predicting the images. This chapter will also teach you to classify datasets, training and putting it all together.<br>

## Chapter (7) - Using Pre-Trained Neural Networks
Using Pre-Trained Neural Networks, will introduce you to pretrained networks and help in predicting image classes using Inception V3 and MobileNet V2. It will also help to extract features generated by Inception V3 and MobileNet V2 and cover transfer learning using Inception V3.<br>

## Chapter (8) - OpenCV
OpenCV, will demonstrate how to use the open source Open CV library to perform real-time computer vision analysis. We will learn to find faces on images and then track them on a video stream.<br>

## Chapter (9) - Case Study – Book Cover Classification, Analysis and Recognition
Case Study – Book Cover Classification, Analysis and Recognition, will incorporate the various techniques that we've described all along the book to develop a Book cover classification, analysis, and recognition project.<br>

Iam currently a Final-year BS.c student at the Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Najafabad Branch (IAUN) (Rank in CWUR) where I am a member of the Bioinformatics Laboratory (BL), advised by Prof. Mohammad Naderi Dehkordi. my research involves machine vision, deep learning, and neural networks. where I will complete my thesis on Accurate and Early Identification of Diabetes and it's Affecting Factors.

Prior to BL, I finished my Diploma - Mathematics and Physics in Sheikh Ansari Highschool, in September 2015. I tried to use my Diploma to build a solid bedrock for my future research. So in addition to taking many optional bachelor-level courses on math and computer science. I spent 6 months as an intern Programmer at the "CoTech" in Isfahan.
